            <p><b class="article-lead">The Art Gallery will be opening to an <em>invitation-only</em> group of art enthusiasts across the country on <strong>December 1, 2013</strong>.</b></p>
            <p>The opening of the Art Gallery will coincide with the release of several of Armando Blontio's finest art pieces, including, "Crème de la Crème," which has a mounting anticipation for its debut.</p>
            <p>As a frequently misrespresented artist, Armando Blontio has struggled to uphold his image amidst the criticism. "I hope to dispel the illusion of my self-centeredness, as seen by my critics, with the Art Gallery opening," said Mr. Blontio.</p>
